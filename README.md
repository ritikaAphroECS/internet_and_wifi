## Internet and Wifi

A new Flutter package that checks for an internet connection by opening a socket to a list of specified addresses, each with individual port and timeout. Defaults are provided for convenience. Also this plugin allows Flutter apps to discover network connectivity and configure themselves accordingly. It can distinguish between cellular vs WiFi connection. It also covers the case when the wifi is connected but there is no internet.
